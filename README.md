# Performance-Analysis-and-Visualisation-of-Company-Operations


## üìä Objective
This project focuses on analysing operational data from a logistics company to identify delivery delays, high operational costs, and inefficiencies. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve performance and optimise resource allocation.

## üìÅ Project Structure
### Datasets:

Deliveries.csv: Delivery details, including delivery times, delays, and customer feedback.
Warehouse_Operations.csv: Warehouse-specific data such as operational costs and processing times.
Fuel_Costs.csv: Data on vehicle fuel consumption and mileage.

### Scripts:

Data_Cleaning.ipynb: Python notebook for cleaning and preparing datasets.
EDA_and_Visualisations.ipynb: Python notebook for exploratory data analysis and visualisation.
Visualisations:


### Reports:

Comprehensive analysis with key findings and recommendations.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Visualisation: Power BI, Tableau
Data Processing: CSV files with simulated logistics data

### üîç Key Insights
High delivery delays in certain regions and vehicle types.
Warehouses with excessive processing times and operational costs.
Trends in fuel consumption based on vehicle type and mileage.

### üí° Recommendations
Optimise delivery routes to minimise delays.
Redistribute staff to improve warehouse efficiency.
Introduce fuel-efficient vehicles to lower costs.

### ‚ú® Highlights
This project demonstrates my ability to:

Work with large datasets.
Clean, analyse, and visualise operational data effectively.
Present actionable insights and recommendations in a professional format.
